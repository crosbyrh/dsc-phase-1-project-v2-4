# Project for Microsoft

The purpose of this project is to help Microsoft find the most effective way to allocate its capital while starting a new movie studio.  
Movies can be extremly expensive to create, so choosing the right type of movie to create (budget size, genre, critical expectation), can potentially have large affects on financial success of the enterprise.   
The Jupyter Notebook in the repository shows and explains how I went about brining in appropriate data sets from public sources and processing that data to come to strategic conclusions/suggestions. 
The repository contains the data locations and also the notebook with the data analysis.
